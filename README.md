## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 20

## Self-Reflection:
<!-- Write your self-reflection under this line -->
A good chunk of this reminds me of my previous co-op, where I had to do a lot of Javascript work. Using Bootstrap makes formatting a *lot* easier.

### How long it took me to finish this?
One and a half hours.

## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?
Primarily used for headings, as it formats the text for that class to be larger. Display-1 is huge and is likely used for front pages, while display-4 would make for a good heading for different sections of a page (i.e. titling different sections of a Wikipedia page).
